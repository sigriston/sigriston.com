I'm Thiago Sigrist, a software developer who likes to talk a lot about things
I'm passionate about. My top interests currently are:

- Systems software development (operating systems, file systems, DBMS etc).
- Full-stack web development.
- JavaScript, which I particularly enjoy.
- Node.js, which turned me on to JavaScript.
- Data Science and Data Analysis.
- R and Python, my favorite tools/languages for data analysis.
- Data Visualization, especially on the web with SVG, canvas, D3 etc.
- Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Deep Learning.
- Computer Vision.
- Statistics and science.
- Videogames obviously.
- Street Fighter in particular.

This website currently hosts only my blog, where I typically discuss things I
love. Feel free to peruse as much as you like.
